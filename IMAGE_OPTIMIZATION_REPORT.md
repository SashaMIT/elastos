## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### WebP Support System
```typescript
// WebPImage Component Features:
- Automatic WebP detection and fallback
- Progressive loading with opacity transitions
- Browser compatibility handling
- Responsive image generation
```

### File Structure
```
client/public/
├── images/                 # Original + WebP versions
├── images-optimized/       # Temporary optimization output
├── images-backup/          # Backup of originals
└── responsive/             # Multiple sizes for hero images
```

### Smart Fallback Logic
1. **WebP First:** Browsers supporting WebP get optimized versions
2. **PNG/JPEG Fallback:** Older browsers get original formats
3. **Error Handling:** Automatic fallback if WebP fails to load
