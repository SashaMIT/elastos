🔐 Digital Identity Management
Empower a world where users control their digital lives.
Elastos DID is not just a decentralized login—it's a verifiable, self-sovereign identity system for people, devices, and assets. Unlike third-party OAuth systems, Elastos DID gives users complete control over how their data is shared across applications.

💡 What You Can Build:

Passwordless login systems that authenticate users via blockchain-anchored DID.
Platforms where users own and control their personal profiles—porting them across apps.
Subscription services that authenticate users via verifiable credentials, not email-password pairs.
KYC/AML-compliant apps that respect privacy through selective disclosure.
🔧 Tech Used:
Elastos DID, Hive (for storing verifiable credentials), Carrier (for DID-based comms), ESC (for permissioning access via smart contracts).

📊 Data Marketplaces
Turn personal data into a personal asset.
Using Elastos DID + Hive, users can selectively package, price, and sell their own data. Buyers verify data provenance via DID, while Hive ensures it's stored securely and off-chain.

💡 What You Can Build:

Marketplaces where users license their health or fitness data to researchers.
AI training datasets with verifiable origin and usage rights tied to creators.
Anonymous web browsing where attention data is paid for in ELA.
Zero-party marketing platforms where users opt in to share insights with brands.
🔧 Tech Used:
Hive (personal vaults), DID (ownership/auth), ESC (settlement), ELA (payments).

🎨 NFT Platforms
Go beyond ownership—build programmable digital rights.
Elastos NFTs are not just tokens—they’re tied to verifiable creators via DID and powered by a full rights system. Integrate DRM, fractional ownership, or time-based access to digital goods using ESC and smart contracts.

💡 What You Can Build:

NFT marketplaces with auto-enforced royalties and DID-authenticated creators.
Music platforms where fans buy limited access to tracks, albums, or live sessions.
Film or eBook platforms where NFTs unlock access instead of downloads.
Games where in-game items are truly user-owned, tradable, and provably scarce.
🔧 Tech Used:
DID (authorship), ESC (NFT logic), Hive (media hosting), Elacity Runtime (playback rules).

🗣 Decentralized Social Media
Own your audience. Own your content.
Elastos enables serverless, censorship-resistant social media, where users are verified via DID, posts are stored via Hive, and interactions flow P2P via Carrier. No ads. No exploitation.

💡 What You Can Build:

Twitter-style platforms where no central party can delete or shadowban posts.
Creators owning their followership with portable DIDs across social dApps.
Voice chat apps where connections are encrypted and peer-to-peer.
Messaging dApps that store message history in personal Hive vaults.
🔧 Tech Used:
Carrier (P2P communication), DID (user identity), Hive (content storage), ESC (tipping or governance).

📡 Secure IoT Networks
The internet of trusted devices.
Elastos lets you assign DIDs to IoT devices, enabling secure machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous microtransactions. Carrier allows P2P comms without centralized servers. DIDs let devices prove who they are—no spoofing, no hijacking.

💡 What You Can Build:

Smart home networks where devices talk to each other securely without cloud relays.
Supply chain IoT sensors with verifiable identities and tamper-proof data.
Industrial control systems that prevent rogue device injection.
Automated vehicles that transact tolls or energy payments in real time.
🔧 Tech Used:
DID (device identity), Carrier (mesh networking), ESC (payment logic), ELA (value transfer).

🗳 Decentralized Governance
Transparent decisions. Verified voters. Immutable records.
Elastos DAO infrastructure lets you build governance systems with real identity, not bots. Use DID to authenticate voters, ESC to manage proposals, and Hive to store minutes or on-chain referenda.

💡 What You Can Build:

Local or national governance tools for communities, DAOs, or NGOs.
Protocol DAOs with anti-sybil voting and smart contract-controlled treasuries.
Alumni or membership orgs where verified identity enables trusted participation.
Funding DAOs that allow creators to raise capital and report progress to token holders.
🔧 Tech Used:
DID (voter verification), ESC (DAO logic), Hive (record-keeping), ELA (collateral/staking).

🎓 Verifiable Credentials
Issue, hold, and verify digital credentials—no middlemen needed.
Using Elastos DID, institutions can issue tamper-proof certificates that are easily verified on-chain but stored privately off-chain by users.

💡 What You Can Build:

University diplomas that can be instantly verified by employers.
Professional licenses (law, medicine, trades) with cryptographic proof.
Event tickets or certifications that can’t be forged or transferred without rules.
Citizen IDs with selective data disclosure (e.g., prove you’re over 18 without showing DOB).
🔧 Tech Used:
DID (issuer + holder), Hive (credential storage), ESC (rules + revocation), ELA (fee/payment).

📺 Digital Content Marketplace
Creators distribute and monetize with total control.
With Elastos, content isn’t streamed from centralized servers—it’s stored in Hive, verified with DID, and monetized via ESC smart contracts or ELA payments. Elacity makes this easy with tools for access control, licensing, and dynamic pricing.

💡 What You Can Build:

A Spotify alternative where artists publish and get paid instantly, per stream.
eBook platforms where ownership is NFT-based, not platform-locked.
Video marketplaces where viewers pay per view or rent content directly.
Content subscription services where credentials control access tiers.
🔧 Tech Used:
Hive (media hosting), DID (creator + consumer identity), ESC (access rights), Elacity Runtime, ELA (settlement).

🗄 Decentralized Storage Solutions
Own your data vault. Choose your host. Control your access.
Elastos Hive allows users and developers to store data in personal, permissioned vaults—with end-to-end encryption and total data portability. Hive can be self-hosted, trusted-hosted, or decentralized across community nodes.

💡 What You Can Build:

Decentralized Dropbox alternatives.
Messaging apps where chat histories are user-owned, not cloud-controlled.
Decentralized CRMs or productivity suites where no provider sees your files.
Healthcare apps where patient records live with the patient.
🔧 Tech Used:
Hive (data storage), DID (access control), Carrier (data routing), ESC (payment/token gating).

📦 Supply Chain Tracking
Transparency you can verify, not just trust.
Elastos enables every item or actor in a supply chain to carry a DID, log their touchpoints immutably on-chain, and report status/data via secure protocols.

💡 What You Can Build:

Food traceability systems from farm to fork.
Anti-counterfeit platforms for luxury goods or pharmaceuticals.
Shipment tracking for eCommerce with real-time updates via IoT + Hive.
ESG compliance dashboards that show full product lifecycle data.
🔧 Tech Used:
DID (actor/item IDs), Hive (data logs), Carrier (device comms), ESC (traceability tokens).

💸 Decentralized Finance
Unbanked. Unchained. Unstoppable.
Elastos ESC is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract chain secured by Bitcoin’s hashpower. Build lending markets, liquidity pools, and stable assets with confidence. DID gives identity. Hive gives storage. ELA powers it all.
