Security & Trust
Bitcoin-Backed Protection & Reserve Asset
ELA is secured through merged mining with Bitcoin, leveraging Bitcoin’s immense hash power. This makes Elastos one of the most secure blockchain networks in existence. Transactions are validated using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), combining Bitcoin’s security with Elastos' efficiency. ELA acts as a reserve asset within the Elastos ecosystem, ensuring economic stability for decentralized applications and services.

Governance & Decentralization
Elastos DAO
ELA is the governance token used in the Elastos DAO, Elastos' decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). ELA holders can vote on proposals, fund projects, and participate in decision-making. Anyone who wishes to become an elected council member must place 5,000 ELA down as collateral to participate in the yearly elections. This ensures that Elastos evolves based on community consensus rather than centralized control.

Digital Identity & Ownership
Elastos DID
ELA enables the creation and management of Decentralized IDs (DIDs), allowing users to own and control their digital identity. Every DID on Elastos is anchored on the blockchain, ensuring verifiable and tamper-proof credentials where ELA is the underlying gas fee.

Fueling Transactions & Applications
ELA is used for gas fees on Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC), an Ethereum-compatible sidechain that supports dApps and DeFi. Developers use ELA to deploy smart contracts and build decentralized applications (dApps). Transactions on the Elastos network (e.g., token transfers, DID registrations) require ELA as a network fee. Elastos is built to scale horizontally with multiple sidechains, such as ESC and DID, each with the ability to use ELA as gas for their economies.

Digital Economy & Asset Management
ELA can be used for peer-to-peer payments, digital asset purchases, and staking within the Elastos ecosystem. Users and businesses can tokenize assets, manage royalties, and create DRM-protected digital content using Elastos-powered platforms like Elacity. ELA facilitates the ownership, trade, and monetization of digital assets without intermediaries. DeFi capabilities, including borrowing, lending, and staking, are enabled within the Elastos ecosystem, expanding ELA’s use beyond transactions into financial services.
