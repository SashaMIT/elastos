ELA Utility: Powering the Smart Web

The Backbone of the Elastos Ecosystem

ELA is the native digital asset that fuels Elastos' decentralized internet, providing security, governance, and utility across the Smart Web.

ðŸ”¥ Core Functions of ELA

1. Security & Trust: Bitcoin-Backed Protection & Reserve Asset

ELA is secured through merged mining with Bitcoin, leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s immense hash power.

This makes Elastos one of the most secure blockchain networks in existence.

Transactions are validated using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), combining Bitcoinâ€™s security with Elastos' efficiency.

ELA acts as a reserve asset within the Elastos ecosystem, ensuring economic stability for decentralized applications and services.

2. Governance & Decentralization: Elastos DAO

ELA is the governance token used in the Elastos DAO, Elastos' decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

ELA holders can vote on proposals, fund projects, and participate in decision-making.

Anyone who wishes to become an elected council member must place 5,000 ELA down as collateral to participate in the yearly elections.

This ensures that Elastos evolves based on community consensus rather than centralized control.

3. Digital Identity & Ownership: Elastos DID

ELA enables the creation and management of Decentralized IDs (DIDs), allowing users to own and control their digital identity.

Every DID on Elastos is anchored on the blockchain, ensuring verifiable and tamper-proof credentials where ELA is the underlying gas fee.

4. Smart Web Services: Fueling Transactions & Applications

ELA is used for gas fees on Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC), an Ethereum-compatible sidechain that supports dApps and DeFi.

Developers use ELA to deploy smart contracts and build decentralized applications (dApps).

Transactions on the Elastos network (e.g., token transfers, DID registrations) require ELA as a network fee.

Elastos is built to scale horizontally with multiple sidechains, such as ESC and DID, each with the ability to use ELA as gas for their economies.

5. Digital Economy & Asset Management

ELA can be used for peer-to-peer payments, digital asset purchases, and staking within the Elastos ecosystem.

Users and businesses can tokenize assets, manage royalties, and create DRM-protected digital content using Elastos-powered platforms like Elacity.

ELA facilitates the ownership, trade, and monetization of digital assets without intermediaries.

DeFi capabilities, including borrowing, lending, and staking, are enabled within the Elastos ecosystem, expanding ELAâ€™s use beyond transactions into financial services.

ðŸ“Š ELA Tokenomics

Total Supply: 28.2 million ELA (gradually reducing via mining emissions).

Consensus: Hybrid AuxPoW + DPoS for security and efficiency.

Staking & Voting: ELA can be staked to earn rewards and vote in the Cyber Republic DAO.

ðŸš€ Why ELA Matters

ðŸ”¹ A Token With Real Utility

Unlike speculative tokens, ELA is a functional asset that powers an entire decentralized internet infrastructure.

ðŸ”¹ Strong Security Backing

With Bitcoin merge-mining, ELA transactions benefit from the worldâ€™s most secure blockchain network.

ðŸ”¹ Decentralized, Not Corporate-Controlled

ELA holders collectively shape the future of the Smart Web, ensuring no single entity controls the network.

ðŸ”¹ Enabling the Digital Rights & DeFi Economy

From identity to ownership, payments, and governance, ELA is the fuel of Web3â€™s next evolution, supporting DeFi, borrowing, lending, and the monetization of digital content.
