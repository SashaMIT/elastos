🧠 Elastos Vision: Building the World Computer

Elastos is creating the World Computer—an open, programmable internet where users own their data, identity, and assets, powered by the most secure blockchain infrastructure in existence.

This isn’t just a blockchain or a smart contract platform. It’s the missing layer of the internet: a complete re-architecture of how information, applications, and value move across the web. The World Computer integrates decentralized computation, identity, storage, and communication—all governed by its users, not corporations.

A platform designed for full-stack decentralization, Elastos combines Bitcoin-backed security with modular Web3 infrastructure, empowering anyone to build sovereign apps and launch their own digital economies.

🔹 Core Tenets of the World Computer

Trustless by DesignSecured by Bitcoin’s hashpower via merged mining, Elastos offers the most secure base layer in the Web3 ecosystem.

Owned by the UserThrough Elastos’ Decentralized Identity (DID), every person, asset, and device has a self-sovereign ID, verifiable on-chain and owned by its rightful holder.

Programmable by AllDevelopers can build across a horizontally scalable multi-chain architecture, launching EVM-compatible dApps and smart contracts powered by ELA.

Peer-to-Peer by DefaultElastos Carrier enables encrypted, decentralized messaging and networking without centralized servers.

Persistent and Sovereign DataWith Elastos Hive, users store, serve, and monetize their data in private cloud vaults that they own—not Big Tech.

Governed by Its PeopleThrough the Elastos DAO and Cyber Republic, the ecosystem evolves based on transparent, community-led governance—enabling anyone to propose, fund, and build.

🌐 Why the World Needs This

The Web is Broken: Data is exploited, identity is owned by platforms, and central points of failure dominate.

The Future Needs Trust: Web3 must deliver more than tokens—it must deliver sovereignty, privacy, and resilience.

Users Want Ownership: People deserve control over their identities, creative works, and digital relationships.

Developers Need Tools: Builders need open infrastructure that is modular, scalable, and secure.

Bitcoin Deserves a Future: Elastos gives Bitcoin a layer-2 vision—where the world's most secure network powers the most advanced internet.

🛠 What You Can Build With Elastos

Decentralized Apps — dApps with native DID login, secure storage, and encrypted communication.

Digital Nations — Communities, platforms, and networks that govern themselves via DAO infrastructure.

Decentralized Marketplaces — Platforms like Elacity where creators tokenize and control access to their digital work.

DeFi Platforms — Borrowing, lending, staking, and on-chain economies secured by ELA and DID.

P2P Web Services — User-hosted websites, APIs, and cloud services shared via Elastos Carrier.

🌍 A World Computer for Everyone

Elastos is more than an ecosystem—it’s an internet built on open values:

No centralized control.

No surveillance capitalism.

No compromise on security.

ELA is the oil of this machine—the single asset that powers the World Computer’s economy, governance, and trust.

Own your identity. Own your data. Own your internet.

Build on Elastos. Power the World Computer.
