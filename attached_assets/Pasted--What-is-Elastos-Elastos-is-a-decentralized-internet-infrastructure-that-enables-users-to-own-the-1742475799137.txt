ðŸ”¹ What is Elastos?â€¨Elastos is a decentralized internet infrastructure that enables users to own their data, identity, and digital assets, all secured by Bitcoinâ€™s security through merged mining. It combines blockchain, decentralized identity (DID), storage, and P2P communication to create a trustless, censorship-resistant Smart Web.
ðŸ”¹ What problem does Elastos solve?â€¨The current internet is controlled by centralized entities that exploit user data, censor content, and compromise security. Elastos returns control to users by enabling true digital sovereignty, where individuals own their identities, assets, and interactions without middlemen.
ðŸ”¹ How is Elastos different from other blockchains?â€¨Unlike most blockchains that focus on DeFi or NFTs alone, Elastos provides a complete decentralized internet framework, including:â€¨âœ… Decentralized ID (DID): Self-sovereign identity for authenticationâ€¨âœ… Elastos Carrier: Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without centralized serversâ€¨âœ… Elastos Hive: Decentralized storage for secure data ownershipâ€¨âœ… Elastos Runtime: Decentralized execution layer for secure dApp operationsâ€¨âœ… Smart Contracts (EVM-Compatible): For decentralized applications (dApps)â€¨âœ… Bitcoin-Level Security: Merged mining with Bitcoin to secure the blockchainâ€¨âœ… BeL2 (Bitcoin Elastos Layer-2): A next-generation Layer-2 scaling solution that enhances Bitcoin with smart contract capabilities and decentralized identity
ðŸ”¹ Is Elastos a cryptocurrency?â€¨Elastos is an entire ecosystem, not just a cryptocurrency. However, ELA is the native token used for transactions, governance, and staking within the network.

ðŸ”¹ How does Elastos use Bitcoin for security?â€¨Elastos uses Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), meaning it is merged-mined with Bitcoin. This allows Bitcoin miners to secure Elastos without extra energy consumption, leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s immense hashpower for security.
ðŸ”¹ What is BeL2 (Bitcoin Elastos Layer-2)?â€¨BeL2 is Elastosâ€™s Layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, designed to bring decentralized identity (DID), smart contracts, and secure data management to the Bitcoin network. It allows for fast, low-cost transactions and dApp functionality while still benefiting from Bitcoinâ€™s unmatched security.
ðŸ”¹ What is Elastos DID (Decentralized Identity)?â€¨Elastos Decentralized ID (DID) is a self-sovereign identity system where users own and control their digital identities without relying on Google, Facebook, or governments. Your DID is stored on the blockchain, allowing you to authenticate yourself privately and securely across applications.
ðŸ”¹ What is the Elastos World Computer?â€¨The World Computer is Elastosâ€™s vision for a decentralized internet where users own their data, applications are sandboxed for security, and interactions happen peer-to-peer without central servers.
ðŸ”¹ How does Elastos protect user privacy?
* No central servers â€“ Everything runs P2P via Elastos Carrier
* No third-party tracking â€“ DID authentication removes the need for password-based logins
* Data belongs to you â€“ Files are stored in Elastos Hive, meaning no platform can take them away
ðŸ”¹ How does Elastos compare to Web3?â€¨While Web3 is a broad concept, Elastos is a complete Web3 operating system, not just a blockchain. Most Web3 projects focus on DeFi or NFTsâ€”Elastos provides the foundational tools for a fully decentralized internet.
