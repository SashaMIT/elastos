What is Elastos DAO?
Formerly known as the Cyber Republic, the Elastos DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the development, direction, and funding of the Elastos ecosystem. It puts ELA holders in control, letting them participate in elections, submit proposals, fund projects, and maintain ecosystem integrity—without corporate gatekeepers.

Elastos DAO is not just governance for a blockchain—it is governance for a new internet.

Mainchain (Secured by Bitcoin)
The core blockchain of Elastos is secured through merged mining with Bitcoin, providing unprecedented security to the entire ecosystem.

ELA Token
The native Elastos token is used for staking, voting, and DAO budgeting across the ecosystem.
