🔴 Critical Errors (Must fix to compile)
JSX must have one parent element

File: SiteFooter.tsx

Meaning: Multiple JSX elements at the top level without a wrapper.

Severity: 🔥 Blocks rendering.

Fix: Wrap elements in a <div> or <>...</> fragment.

Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for div

File: VisionPage.tsx:38

Meaning: An opening tag like <div> is never closed.

Severity: 🔥 JSX syntax will break.

Fix: Match every <div> with a </div>.

JSX element <new_str> has no closing tag

File: VisionPage.tsx:39

Meaning: <new_str> is not a valid JSX element (likely leftover merge conflict marker).

Severity: 🔥 Fatal JSX error.

Fix: Remove <new_str> and <old_str>, replace with real JSX.

) expected / Expression expected

File: VisionPage.tsx:186–187

Meaning: Malformed return block—probably missing a closing bracket or JSX not well-formed.

Severity: 🔥 Breaks the component.

Fix: Check return structure and JSX for completeness.

NavigationMenuTrigger not closed

File: NavMenu.tsx:46

Meaning: The JSX tag is malformed; looks like <NavigationMenuTrigger>...</NavigationMenuTrigger> is written incorrectly.

Severity: 🔥 Compiler will fail.

Fix: Correct to valid JSX tag with matching open/close.

Unexpected token. Did you mean {'>'} or &gt;?

File: NavMenu.tsx:46

Meaning: Likely stray text or malformed tag (e.g. forgot to close a string or JSX).

Severity: 🔥 Invalid syntax.

Fix: Fix malformed string or JSX tag. Don’t embed tag names as text.

🟠 Moderate Errors (Builds, but bad behavior)
@import must precede all other statements

File: index.css, other .css files

Meaning: @import must be at the top before @tailwind or any other rule.

Severity: ⚠️ Breaks Tailwind or custom CSS.

Fix: Move all @import lines to the top of the CSS file.

🟡 Minor / Dev Experience
HMR (Hot Module Replacement) export issue

File: FaqComponent.tsx

Meaning: Probably exporting an object or named export incompatible with HMR.

Severity: ⚠️ Won’t block build, but hot reload won’t work.

Fix: Use export default for main components.

EADDRINUSE — port already in use

File: Dev server (Vite)

Meaning: Port 5173 is occupied.

Severity: ❗️Blocks local dev server.

Fix: Either kill the process on that port (lsof -i :5173 && kill PID) or change the port.
