It's through this journey that I've come to believe the future of AI belongs to local models running on personal devices, beyond the reach of centralized power. Elastos isn't just enabling this, it's actively building it, and I'm proud to be part of it as an Elastos DAO member."

In the digital world, we're constant assets, yet the value we create rarely comes back to us. Elastos is building tools for a fairer digital future and anyone can join the community and own a piece of the network with ELA. Im very grateful for the amazing people and experiences I've found through Elastos."

Now it's even bigger! With Elacity, BeL2, DIDs, carrier and storage. The 'World Computer' idea is around the corner and it's so ridiculously exciting! I totally adore the Elastos community too, some of the most passionate, friendly and welcoming people."
